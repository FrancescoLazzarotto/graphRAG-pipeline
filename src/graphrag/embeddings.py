"""Multilingual sentence encoder shared by the KG vector index and the retriever.

The graph was extracted from a bilingual corpus and most concepts carry their
Italian surface form, while the questions are English; lexical retrieval cannot
cross that gap (``exp_results/KG_VS_RETRIEVAL.md``). Encoding node names and
questions into one multilingual space is the bridge, so index build time and
query time must use the *same* model, prefixes and pooling — a mismatch there
degrades similarity silently instead of failing. Hence a single module, and a
single transport.

That transport is an OpenAI-compatible ``/v1/embeddings`` endpoint, the pattern
this project already uses for generation::

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 vllm serve intfloat/multilingual-e5-base \\
        --runner pooling --port 8002 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.12 \\
        --max-model-len 512

Running the encoder in-process was the obvious alternative and does not work
here: the ``graphllm`` environment pairs torch 2.5.1 with torchvision 0.25.0, so
importing any ``transformers`` text model dies with ``operator torchvision::nms
does not exist`` (the torch/torchvision row in CLAUDE.md). Serving it from the
``vllm-serve`` virtualenv keeps both environments untouched.

The e5 family is trained with ``query:`` / ``passage:`` prefixes; they are not
optional and are applied here so no caller can forget one.
