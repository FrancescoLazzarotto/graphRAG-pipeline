"""Deterministic question typing: definitional and enumerative questions.

WP3/WP4 of ``docs/demo_quality_plan_2026-07.md``. Two question shapes need a
different retrieval and a different answer:

* **definitional** — "che cos'è SEeD?". The answer *is* the author's wording, so
  the chunk carrying the verbatim definition must outrank the chunks that merely
  mention the term, and the answer must quote before it paraphrases.
* **enumerative** — "quali sono le 5 filiere?". The items usually live in one
  list inside one document, on contiguous pages, so the per-document cap that
  diversifies every other question actively hurts this one.

Both detectors are regex-based on purpose: an LLM classifier would add a call, a
failure mode and nondeterminism to every turn, for a decision a pattern makes
just as well and a test can pin down.

Nothing here imports from :mod:`graphrag.agent` or :mod:`graphrag.kg`: the
retriever, the prompt library and the agent all need it, and a shared leaf
module is what keeps that from becoming an import cycle.
