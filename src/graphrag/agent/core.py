        """Names the graph holds for the proper nouns in ``question``.

        One indexed lookup, never a scan: when the full-text index is
        unavailable ``fulltext_search_nodes`` returns None and the gate runs on
        exactly the wording it was validated with, which is the behaviour to
        degrade to.

        The index tokenises, so it answers "documents mentioning these terms",
        not "nodes named this". The word-boundary filter afterwards is what
        makes the answer a name: without it a question about SEeD would be told
        the collection contains "Potatoes, Curd, and Linseed Oil".

        It also inherits the index's own blind spot. Lucene's tokeniser keeps
        an underscore inside a token, so the node "REPORT MATTM_Definitivo.pdf"
        is unreachable by the term MATTM and no hint is produced for it — the
        gate then runs on the model's own judgement, as it did before. Nothing
        to work around here: the fix belongs in what
        `scripts/kg/kg_search_index.py` feeds the index.
