"""Judging rubrics and the per-row rubric selection.

Each rubric declares two things the prompt builder needs in order to keep the
comparison fair across pipelines (docs/gold_eval_implementation_plan.md §5):

* ``uses_ground_truth`` — whether the gold answer may appear in the prompt at
  all. Reference-free rubrics never see it: instructing a model to ignore what
  is put in front of it is not a control (§5.5).
* ``applies_to`` — the kind of row the rubric is meaningful on. On a distractor
  the only correct answer is an abstention, which by definition does not address
  the question, so the answerable rubrics would punish the right behaviour (§5.3).
