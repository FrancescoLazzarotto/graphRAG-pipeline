"""Prompt construction for the LLM judge.

Single source of truth for every string the judge model sees: backends are handed
a (system, user) pair and never assemble prompt text themselves.

Two fairness properties are enforced here
(docs/gold_eval_implementation_plan.md §5.1, §5.5):

* **The prompt does not reveal which pipeline produced the answer.** All evidence
  goes through :func:`render_evidence`: one header, one line per element, triples
  serialised as statements, and one character budget for everybody. Emitting
  ``## Retrieved Text Contexts`` or ``## Retrieved KG Triples`` depending on what
  a row happened to carry told the judge which system it was scoring, and capping
  by element count (5 chunks vs 20 triples) handed the text pipelines an order of
  magnitude more evidence.
* **The ground truth reaches only the rubrics that ask for it.** A rubric that
  declares ``uses_ground_truth = False`` never has the gold answer in its prompt.
