"""Gazetteer mention extraction from running text (plan §6, answer channel).

Deterministic post-hoc extractor: finds gold surface forms (normalised_label +
alt_labels) in generated text via whole-word matching on the shared
``match_key`` folding. It closes the structural asymmetry where graph
pipelines report ``retrieved_entities`` but text-RAG reports none, so the
baseline scores 0 by construction: the same gazetteer and the same
normalisation are applied to every pipeline's ANSWER text, symmetrically.

There is no model and no threshold, so the only pre-registered choices are the
gazetteer source (the gold's own surface forms) and the folding
(``evalkit.normalisation.match_key``).

Known, accepted limitation: a gazetteer can only see gold vocabulary. Answer
text naming entities outside the gold (correct or hallucinated) is invisible
here, so answer-channel precision is measured against the gold vocabulary
only, not against an open vocabulary. Recall is the meaningful direction. An
open-vocabulary extractor (e.g. GLiNER) would need a threshold pre-registered
before any gold run; it is deliberately out of this module.
