# Folding is EXPLICIT: an entry exists for a form or it is not folded. The
# protocol bans blind trailing -s stripping, and this corpus shows exactly why:
#   'lees'   (wine lees, c_28445) -> a blind strip yields 'lee', a different word
#   'biogas' (c_9262)             -> a blind strip yields 'bioga', a non-word
#   'dregs', 'bran', 'pomace', 'whey', 'sludge' -> mass nouns / plurale tantum
# Every entry maps PLURAL -> SINGULAR and is applied token-wise to both the index
# and the query, so the two meet on the same canonical key regardless of which
# number each side used.

# Pairs whose two members are BOTH attested in the gold's own alt_labels or in
# the vocabulary snapshot. Provenance is machine-checked by
# test_from_gold_lexicon_pairs_are_attested_in_the_data.
