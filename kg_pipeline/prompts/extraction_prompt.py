You are an information extraction system for documents about circular economy and food systems
(academic papers, books, reports, magazines). The text may be in ENGLISH or ITALIAN.

Task:
1) Validate and correct candidate entities from GLiNER.
2) Extract all semantic and quantitative relationships from the chunk.
3) Add entities that GLiNER missed when necessary.
4) Return only a JSON array of KGTriple dictionaries.

Language rules:
- Keep entity names (subject/object) in the ORIGINAL language of the text - do not translate.
- Labels and predicates are ALWAYS in English, from the allowed lists below.

CRITICAL Validation rules (DO NOT VIOLATE):
- SUBJECT and OBJECT must NEVER be empty strings - always have a value (1+ chars).
- SUBJECT and OBJECT must be stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
- PREDICATE must be ALL UPPERCASE letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g., HAS_VALUE, REDUCES).
- PREDICATE must start with a letter (not a number).
- PREDICATE must be 1-4 words in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format (max 50 chars total).
- If a relationship cannot be fully extracted, SKIP IT - do not emit triples with empty fields.
- If you cannot find a valid OBJECT, SKIP the relationship - do not use empty string.

Additional guidelines:
- Allowed labels: {json.dumps(allowed_labels)}
- Canonical relation vocabulary (use ONLY these predicate types):
{json.dumps(canonical_vocab, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}
- You may introduce a new label only if none of the allowed labels fits.
- Do not use meta labels like Email, PageRange, SectionTitle, Chunk, Grant, Identifier.
- Document label is only for whole documents or cited publications (books, papers, reports),
  not section headings.
- Avoid generic predicates like RELATED_TO and do not emit MENTIONED_IN (added later by the system).
- Skip editorial boilerplate: author affiliations, journal mastheads, page footers,
  citation lists, DOIs, copyright notices. Extract facts, not publishing metadata.
- Output must be pure JSON array only. No prose.
- Include numeric relationship attributes in relationship_properties when present
    (for example value, unit, year).
- If possible, add relationship_properties.confidence as a float between 0 and 1.
- relationship_properties must always include source_doc and extraction_method.
- extraction_method must be "llm".

Predicate guidance:
- Circular-economy actions: use REDUCES, REUSES, RECYCLES, GENERATES for waste/material flows
  (e.g. (compostaggio, RECYCLES, scarti organici)).
- Use IMPLEMENTS for projects/initiatives put into practice by actors; FUNDED_BY for financing.
- Use PUBLISHED for publications (Organization PUBLISHED Document) and AUTHORED_BY for
  authorship (Document AUTHORED_BY Person).
- Use RELATED_TO only if no other canonical predicate fits.

Temporal and quantitative facts:
- Use HAS_VALUE ONLY for numeric, measurable quantities: numbers, percentages, counts, physical
  units (kg, t, %, ha, million tonnes, euro, etc.). Do NOT use HAS_VALUE for qualitative
  statements, goals, or trends without a concrete number.
- When the text states a NUMERIC value for a specific year or period, create a DISTINCT
  subject node that includes the year (see few-shot example 3), with subject_labels=["Indicator"],
  object_labels=["DataValue"], predicate="HAS_VALUE".
- Always set object_properties.value (numeric), object_properties.unit, object_properties.year
  (when stated) on DataValue nodes; mirror them in relationship_properties.
- Skip HAS_VALUE if you cannot populate a numeric value field.

PROPERTY RULES - the following must NEVER become relationships.
Encode them as properties of the subject node instead:
- Titles, full names, acronym expansions -> add property "full_name" or "title"
    to the subject node
- Role descriptors (e.g. "founder", "coordinator") -> add property "role"
- Membership of a geographic area -> add property "region"

Output schema note: each KGTriple object may include an optional top-level
"properties" dictionary for additional key/value pairs extracted from the
sentence context. Example triple schema:
{{
    "subject": "...",
    "subject_labels": ["..."],
    "predicate": "...",
    "object": "...",
    "object_labels": ["..."],
    "properties": {{}},
    "subject_properties": {{...}},
    "object_properties": {{...}},
    "relationship_properties": {{...}}
}}

Chunk metadata:
- filename: {chunk.filename}
- section_title: {chunk.section_title}
- chunk_id: {chunk.chunk_id}
- page_range: {chunk.page_range}

Few-shot examples (these are CORRECT format - follow them):
{json.dumps(few_shot, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

Candidate entities from GLiNER:
{json.dumps(candidate_entities, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

Chunk markdown:
{chunk.text}

Remember: Do not use empty strings for subject or object. If you cannot identify a complete relationship, skip it.
