"""A page carrying three headings used to become one section, and lost the rest.

`_extract_sections` broke out of the page after the first heading, and a running
header broke out of the page entirely. On the production corpus that discarded
1 418 of 2 251 headings — 64 % — and `section_title` is both what the extraction
prompt is given and what the back-matter filter matches on.

Recovering them is not a matter of deleting the two `break`s: sections were
page-granular and the chunker takes every page in a section's range, so two
sections starting on the same page both claimed all of it. Measured before
changing it: 34 % of the corpus's pages would have been chunked more than once,
one catalogue page seventeen times, inflating the graph with duplicate triples
and with them the mention counts the retriever ranks on. So a section now
carries an offset into its first and last page.
