"""An off-vocabulary predicate is remapped, not thrown away.

2 224 of the 13 186 triples in the production run — 16.9 % — had their predicate
replaced by RELATED_TO, which became the most frequent edge in a knowledge graph
about food. The remapping itself is right: 704 distinct predicate names came out
of the model, and letting each become a relationship type is what the controlled
vocabulary exists to prevent. Destroying the name is not.

Every triple-returning query in the retriever already reads
``coalesce(properties(r)['predicate'], type(r))``. Nothing had ever written that
property, so the plumbing was there and unused.
