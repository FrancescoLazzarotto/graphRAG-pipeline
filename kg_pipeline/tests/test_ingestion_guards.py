"""Stage 0 must refuse to hand the pipeline a corpus it did not actually read.

`--single-doc typo.pdf` used to pass every check: the path list was non-empty,
the loop skipped the file that was not there, and stage 0 returned zero
documents. Stages 1-4 then ran to completion on nothing and the run looked
successful.
