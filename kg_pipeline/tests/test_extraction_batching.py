"""Stage 3's dispatch window and its checkpoint cadence, once separated.

`batch_size = checkpoint_every` made one number mean two unrelated things. A
batch is the dispatch window: every chunk in it is in flight behind a
semaphore, and the next batch cannot start until the slowest one returns. A
checkpoint is how much work a crash costs. Tying them meant that asking for
safer recovery narrowed the window, and widening the window put more work at
risk — with no way to choose one without the other.

What is pinned here is that they are now independent, and that the two
properties the old coupling gave away for free still hold: a checkpoint lands
at least every `checkpoint_every` chunks, and the last one always points at
the last chunk actually done.
