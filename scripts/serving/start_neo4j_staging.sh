# Aura 588fe1bc holds the frozen graph every thesis number was measured on, and
# the expert demo points at it. Rebuilding aliases and adding edges there would
# destroy both at once, so v2 is built here instead and promoted only after it
# is measured. The two can then be compared head to head.
#
# Docker is not usable on this host (the account is not in the docker group), so
# this is the unpacked Community tarball run as a user process, with a JDK 21
# from the `neo4jrt` conda env because the system JDK is 11 and Neo4j 5 needs 17+.
#
# Bolt is on 7689, HTTP on 7476. 7687 is the default and 7688/7475 are held by
# the July staging instance under /mnt/storage/flazzarotto/neo4j-staging, which
# is still running and is left alone.
