# Replace the Aura graph with the staging graph, once staging has been measured.
#
# Deliberately a full replace, not a delta. A delta pass would have to match
# staging nodes to Aura nodes by name, and the graph has 98 groups of nodes that
# share a normalised name — every one of them a chance to write an alias onto
# the wrong node, silently. A dump and restore has no such ambiguity, and every
# step below already exists and is already used elsewhere.
#
# The cost of a full replace is that Aura reassigns element identifiers, which
# is exactly what killed the vector index in July: the carriers survive, their
# `of` pointers go stale, and retrieval quietly degrades to lexical matching
# instead of failing. Hence the rebuild and the guard at the end, in that order,
# and hence the refusal to skip them.
#
#   bash scripts/serving/promote_staging_to_aura.sh          # dry run: prints the plan

DRY RUN. This would:

  1. dump Aura to ${AURA_SAFETY}            (the rollback point)
  2. dump staging to ${STAGING_DUMP}
  3. WIPE Aura
  4. restore the staging dump into Aura
  5. rebuild the vector index on Aura
  6. run the resolution guard, and fail loudly if it does not pass

Aura is the graph the expert demo talks to. Re-run with CONFIRM=yes when the
staging graph has actually won its comparison.
