# Sourced by start_demo.sh and stop_demo.sh. It exists because the two used to
# keep their own copies of this table: stop_demo.sh's copy was missing three
# generators and pinned the UI to 8501, so stopping a demo started on any other
# port reported success and left the process holding the port — and the next
# start then said "already up" and served the old build.
#
# Ports come from the same environment variables start_demo.sh honours, so a
# demo started with DEMO_UI_PORT=8600 is a demo stop_demo.sh can find.
