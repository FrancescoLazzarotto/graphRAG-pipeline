"""Refuse to modify a graph that nobody asked to modify.

Helper module, not an entrypoint.

The kg_repair passes rewrite the graph in place: they delete nodes, reverse
relationships and rename relationship types. They take no arguments, print no
usage and ask for no confirmation, and they read their target from
``kg_pipeline/.env`` — which points at the hosted graph the demo serves.

On 2026-08-24 that combination cost the demo graph 1 661 vector carriers, 43
entities, all 532 ``PART_OF`` relationships and the direction of 39 more. The
passes were started by someone checking that a file move had not broken
anything, the ordinary way: running each script with ``--help``. Having no
argument parser, they ignored the flag and did the work.

So the rule here is narrow and absolute: **asking a repair pass what it does
must never make it do it.** Confirmation is explicit, and the target is printed
before anything is written, because "which graph is this pointing at" is the
question that actually matters.

And confirming the action is not confirming the target. These passes read their
target from ``kg_pipeline/.env``, which points at the hosted graph the demo
serves, while the local mirror they are meant for is ``bolt://localhost:7689``.
``--yes`` becomes muscle memory; a write to a remote instance therefore needs
that instance's host named in ``KG_ALLOW_HOSTED_WRITES``, which cannot be typed
by habit.
