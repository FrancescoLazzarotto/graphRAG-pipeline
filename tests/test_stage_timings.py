"""Where a turn's seconds went, recorded per turn rather than probed once.

`latency_ms` says a turn took thirty-three seconds and nothing about which
stage spent them. One probe in September put 93 % in a single LLM call, 5 % in
retrieval and 4 % in the graph — but that was one measurement on one day, and
the executive summary it corrected had blamed the graph. This makes the split
a property of every turn.

No LLM and no graph: the agent's nodes are replaced by functions that sleep a
known amount.
