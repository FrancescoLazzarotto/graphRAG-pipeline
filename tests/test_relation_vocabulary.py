"""The relationship vocabulary is one list, and every pass renames into it.

`neo4j_postprocess` and the three `kg_repair*` scripts used to keep separate
copies of the canonical vocabulary, the repair copies marked "must match
neo4j_postprocess.py". They did not match: the repair copies carried
`HAS_DEFINITION`, and `kg_repair2` renamed `DEFINITION` into it — a type no
other pass considered canonical and which has no instances in the graph.

Equality between the copies is not what these tests check, since there is only
one list now and comparing it to itself would pass forever. They check the two
things that can still go wrong: someone reintroducing a private copy, and a
rename whose target is not in the vocabulary.
