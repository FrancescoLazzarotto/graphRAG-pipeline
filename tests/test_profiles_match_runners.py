"""The profile must equal what the runner scripts actually pass.

`test_profiles.py` checks `THESIS_CAMPAIGN` against a configuration recorded by a
run that already happened. This file checks it against the scripts that will
produce the next one: it reads the real flag block out of each shell runner, lets
bash expand the variable defaults, feeds the result through the CLI's own parser
and config builder, and compares field by field.

Together the two files close the loop from both ends. That is what makes
switching a runner over to `--profile thesis_campaign` a verifiable change rather
than a hopeful one: if the substitution would move any of the 86 fields, this
test says which.

The tests shell out to bash because bash is the authority on its own `${VAR:-default}`
syntax, and reparsing it in Python would only prove that the reimplementation
agrees with itself.
