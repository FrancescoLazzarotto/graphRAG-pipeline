"""The named profiles must reproduce what the campaigns actually ran.

`THESIS_CAMPAIGN` is checked against `tests/fixtures/thesis_campaign_config.json`,
which is the `strategy_configs` block written by `graphrag.cli --experiment` for
a real thesis run (gemma3_27b_awq, 2026-08-18). If a profile field drifts from
what that campaign was measured with, these tests fail -- which is the point:
the profile is only useful if switching a runner over to it cannot move a
published number.
