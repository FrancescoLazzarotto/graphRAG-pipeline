"""A cleanup with thousands of things to delete has stopped meaning what it meant.

With the `:NodeVec` and `name IS NOT NULL` guards missing, the isolated-node
query returned 14 561 candidates on the demo graph — 14 520 of them the vector
carriers that hold the cross-lingual index — and the pass deleted them. With
the guards it returns 41. A cap turns the interesting middle into a question
for a person instead of a DETACH DELETE.

The session is a double that records every statement, so these assert on what
would actually reach the database.
