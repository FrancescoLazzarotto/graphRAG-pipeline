"""A skipped vector channel is skipped for a reason, and the reason is logged.

`_handle_vector_error` used to match "not found" and the procedure's own name,
so any failure of `db.index.vector.queryNodes` — every one of which names the
procedure — was reported as a missing index and returned no rows. The advice
that came with it, "run kg_vector_index.py to build it", was wrong for every
cause except the one it named.

The error texts below are the real ones, taken from a Neo4j 5 Aura instance by
provoking each fault, not paraphrases.
