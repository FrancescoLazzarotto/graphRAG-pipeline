"""The retrieval cache is shared by every browser session, in separate threads.

Streamlit gives each session its own thread and `@st.cache_resource` gives them
all the same agent, so the same `LRUCache`. `OrderedDict` is not safe against
that: `get` looked a key up, moved it to the end and then read it, and an
eviction landing between the lookup and the read raised `KeyError` — a failed
turn for whoever lost the race, on a cache whose whole purpose is to make turns
cheaper.

That window is three bytecodes wide, so it does not open at the default thread
switch interval: the same stress that fails 75 times out of 80 below passed
five runs out of five before these settings were found. `maxsize=1` keeps
eviction constant and a nanosecond switch interval puts a context switch almost
everywhere, which is what makes the test a guard rather than a formality.
