"""The gate that asks the collection instead of describing it.

The scope gate names the domain in its prompt — food, crops, the three C's,
ecodesign. That description is a maintenance trap: the day a document about
something else is added, questions about the new material are refused, and
refused silently. This one is shown what the collection returned and judges
against that, so it widens on its own as documents arrive.

These tests are the structural guards. What the gate actually decides was
measured on 79 labelled questions, not asserted here: 0 wrong refusals out of
53 and 19 correct refusals out of 23, the same score as the scope gate, with
the conjunction bypass closed.
